<p class='line0'>The lamp-light kissed her faded chair,</p>

<p class='line0'>Then back into the world of care—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To bless till life is done—</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Romping about in the old bush way.</p>
<p class='line0'>They were ten little wild March hares,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ah, the memories that find me now my hair is turning gray,</p>
<p class='line0'>Drifting in like painted butterflies from paddocks far away;</p>
<p class='line0'>Dripping dainty wings in fancy—and the pictures, fading fast,</p>
<p class='line0'>Stand again in rose and purple in the album of the past.</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s the old slab dwelling dreaming by the wistful, watchful trees,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the coolabahs are listening to the stories of the breeze;</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s a homely welcome beaming from its big, bright friendly eyes,</p>
<p class='line0'>With The Sugarloaf behind it blackened in against the skies;</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s the same dear happy circle round the boree’s cheery blaze</p>
<p class='line0'>With a little Irish mother telling tales of other days.</p>
<p class='line0'>She had one sweet, holy custom which I never can forget,</p>
<p class='line0'>And a gentle benediction crowns her memory for it yet;</p>
<p class='line0'>I can see that little mother still and hear her as she pleads,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Now it’s getting on to bed-time; all you childer get your beads.”</p>
<p class='line0'>There were no steel-bound conventions in that old slab dwelling free;</p>
<p class='line0'>Only this—each night she lined us up to say the Rosary;</p>
<p class='line0'>E’en the stranger there, who stayed the night upon his journey, knew</p>
<p class='line0'>He must join the little circle, ay, and take his decade too.</p>
<p class='line0'>I believe she darkly plotted, when a sinner hove in sight</p>
<p class='line0'>Who was known to say no prayer at all, to make him stay the night.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then we’d softly gather round her, and we’d speak in accents low,</p>
<p class='line0'>And pray like Sainted Dominic so many years ago;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the little Irish mother’s face was radiant, for she knew</p>
<p class='line0'>That “where two or three are gathered” He is gathered with them too.</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er the paters and the aves how her reverent head would bend!</p>
<p class='line0'>How she’d kiss the cross devoutly when she counted to the end!</p>
<p class='line0'>And the visitor would rise at once, and brush his knees—and then</p>
<p class='line0'>He’d look very, very foolish as he took the boards again.</p>
<p class='line0'>She had other prayers to keep him. They were long, long prayers in truth;</p>
<p class='line0'>And we used to call them “Trimmin’s” in my disrespectful youth.</p>
<p class='line0'>She would pray for kith and kin, and all the friends she’d ever known,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes, and everyone of us could boast a “trimmin’ ” all his own.</p>
<p class='line0'>She would pray for all our little needs, and every shade of care</p>
<p class='line0'>That might darken o’er The Sugarloaf, she’d meet it with a prayer.</p>
<p class='line0'>She would pray for this one’s “sore complaint,” or that one’s “hurted hand,”</p>
<p class='line0'>Or that someone else might make a deal and get “that bit of land”;</p>
<p class='line0'>Or that Dad might sell the cattle well, and seasons good might rule,</p>
<p class='line0'>So that little John, the weakly one, might go away to school.</p>
<p class='line0'>There were trimmin’s, too, that came and went; but ne’er she closed without</p>
<p class='line0'>Adding one for something special “none of you must speak about.”</p>
<p class='line0'>Gentle was that little mother, and her wit would sparkle free,</p>
<p class='line0'>But she’d murder him who looked around while at the Rosary:</p>
<p class='line0'>And if perchance you lost your beads, disaster waited you,</p>
<p class='line0'>For the only one she’d pardon was “himself”—because she knew</p>
<p class='line0'>He was hopeless, and ’twas sinful what excuses he’d invent,</p>
<p class='line0'>So she let him have his fingers, and he cracked them as he went,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, bedad, he wasn’t certain if he’d counted five or ten,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet he’d face the crisis bravely, and would start around again;</p>
<p class='line0'>But she tallied all the decades, and she’d block him on the spot,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a “Glory, Daddah, Glory!” and he’d “Glory” like a shot.</p>
<p class='line0'>She would portion out the decades to the company at large;</p>
<p class='line0'>But when she reached the trimmin’s she would put herself in charge;</p>
<p class='line0'>And it oft was cause for wonder how she never once forgot,</p>
<p class='line0'>But could keep them in their order till she went right through the lot.</p>
<p class='line0'>For that little Irish mother’s prayers embraced the country wide;</p>
<p class='line0'>If a neighbour met with trouble, or was taken ill, or died,</p>
<p class='line0'>We could count upon a trimmin’—till, in fact, it got that way</p>
<p class='line0'>That the Rosary was but trimmin’s to the trimmin’s we would say.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then “himself” would start keownrawning<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>—for the public good, we thought—</p>
<p class='line0'>“Sure you’ll have us here till mornin’. Yerra, cut them trimmin’s short!”</p>
<p class='line0'>But she’d take him very gently, till he softened by degrees—</p>
<p class='line0'>“Well, then, let us get it over. Come now, all hands to their knees.”</p>
<p class='line0'>So the little Irish mother kept her trimmin’s to the last,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ever growing as the shadows o’er the old selection passed;</p>
<p class='line0'>And she lit our drab existence with her simple faith and love,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I know the angels lingered near to bear her prayers above,</p>
<p class='line0'>For her children trod the path she trod, nor did they later spurn</p>
<p class='line0'>To impress her wholesome maxims on their children in their turn.</p>
<p class='line0'>Ay, and every “sore complaint” came right, and every “hurted hand”;</p>
<p class='line0'>And we made a deal from time to time, and got “that bit of land”;</p>
<p class='line0'>And Dad did sell the cattle well; and little John, her pride,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was he who said the Mass in black the morning that she died;</p>
<p class='line0'>So her gentle spirit triumphed—for ’twas this, without a doubt,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was the very special trimmin’ that she kept so dark about.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But the years have crowded past us, and the fledglings all have flown,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the nest beneath The Sugarloaf no longer is their own;</p>
<p class='line0'>For a hand has written “<span class='it'>finis</span>” and the book is closed for good—</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s a stately red-tiled mansion where the old slab dwelling stood;</p>
<p class='line0'>There the stranger has her “evenings,” and the formal supper’s spread,</p>
<p class='line0'>But I wonder has she “trimmin’s” now, or is the Rosary said?</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah, those little Irish mothers passing from us one by one!</p>
<p class='line0'>Who will write the noble story of the good that they have done?</p>
<p class='line0'>All their children may be scattered, and their fortunes windwards hurled,</p>
<p class='line0'>But the Trimmin’s on the Rosary will bless them round the world.</p>

<p class='line0'>’Tis a queer, old battered landmark that belongs to other years;</p>
<p class='line0'>With the dog-leg fence around it, and its hat about its ears,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the cow-bell in the gum-tree, and the bucket on the stool,</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s a motley host of memories round that old bush school—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>With its seedy desks and benches, where at least I left a name</p>
<p class='line0'>Carved in agricultural letters—’twas my only bid for fame;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the spider-haunted ceilings, and the rafters, firmly set,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lined with darts of nibs and paper (doubtless sticking in them yet),</p>
<p class='line0'>And the greasy slates and blackboards, where I oft was proved a fool</p>
<p class='line0'>And a blur upon the scutcheon of the old bush school.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There I see the boots in order—“ ’lastic-sides” we used to wear—</p>
<p class='line0'>With a pair of “everlastin’s” cracked and dusty here and there;</p>
<p class='line0'>And we marched with great “high action”—hands behind and eyes before—</p>
<p class='line0'>While we murdered “Swanee River” as we tramped around the floor.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Still the scholars pass before me with their freckled features grave,</p>
<p class='line0'>And a nickname fitting better than the name their mothers gave;</p>
<p class='line0'>Tousled hair and vacant faces, and their garments every one</p>
<p class='line0'>Shabby heirlooms in the family, handed down from sire to son.</p>
<p class='line0'>Ay, and mine were patched in places, and half-masted, as a rule—</p>
<p class='line0'>They were fashionable trousers at the old bush school.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There I trudged it from the Three-mile, like a patient, toiling brute,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a stocking round my ankle, and my heart within my boot,</p>
<p class='line0'>Morgan, Nell and Michael Joseph, Jim and Mary, Kate and Mart</p>
<p class='line0'>Tramping down the sheep-track with me, little rebels at the heart;</p>
<p class='line0'>Shivery grasses round about us nodding bonnets in the breeze,</p>
<p class='line0'>Happy Jacks and Twelve Apostles<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> hurdle-racing up the trees,</p>

<p class='line0'>Hard bare seats and drab gray humdrum at the old bush school.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Early rising in the half-light, when the morn came, bleak and chill;</p>
<p class='line0'>For the little mother roused us ere the sun had topped the hill,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Up, you children, late ’tis gettin’.” Shook the house beneath her knock,</p>
<p class='line0'>And she wasn’t always truthful, and she tampered with the clock.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Keen she was about “the learnin’,” and she told us o’er and o’er</p>
<p class='line0'>Of our luck to have “the schoolin’ ” right against our very door.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the lectures—Oh, those lectures to our stony hearts addressed!</p>
<p class='line0'>“Don’t be mixin’ with the Regans and the Ryans and the rest”—</p>
<p class='line0'>“Don’t be pickin’ up with Carey’s little talkative kanats”—<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>
<p class='line0'>Well, she had us almost thinking we were born aristocrats.</p>
<p class='line0'>But we found our level early—in disaster, as a rule—</p>
<p class='line0'>For they knocked “the notions” sideways at the old bush school.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Down the road came Laughing Mary, and the beast that she bestrode</p>
<p class='line0'>Was Maloney’s sorry piebald she had found beside the road;</p>
<p class='line0'>Straight we scrambled up behind her, and as many as could fit</p>
<p class='line0'>Clung like circus riders bare-back without bridle-rein or bit,</p>
<p class='line0'>On that corrugated backbone in a merry row we sat—</p>
<p class='line0'>We propelled him with our school-bags; Mary steered him with her hat—</p>
<p class='line0'>And we rolled the road behind us like a ribbon from the spool,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Making butter,” so we called it, to the old bush school.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>What a girl was Mary Casey in the days of long ago!</p>
<p class='line0'>She was queen among the scholars, or at least we thought her so;</p>
<p class='line0'>She was first in every mischief and, when overwhelmed by fate,</p>
<p class='line0'>She could make delightful drawings of the teacher on her slate.</p>
<p class='line0'>There was rhythm in every movement, as she gaily passed along</p>
<p class='line0'>With a rippling laugh that lilted like the music of a song;</p>
<p class='line0'>So we called her “Laughing Mary,” and a fitful fancy blessed</p>
<p class='line0'>E’en the bashful little daisies that her dainty feet caressed.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She had cheeks like native roses in the fullness of their bloom,</p>
<p class='line0'>And she used to sing the sweetest as we marched around the room;</p>
<p class='line0'>In her eyes there lurked the magic, maiden freshness of the morn,</p>
<p class='line0'>In her hair the haunting colour I had seen upon the corn;</p>
<p class='line0'>Round her danced the happy sunshine when she smiled upon the stool—</p>
<p class='line0'>And I used to swap her dinners at the old bush school.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Hard the cobbled road of knowledge to the feet of him who plods</p>
<p class='line0'>After fragile fragments fallen from the workshop of the gods;</p>
<p class='line0'>Long the quest, and ever thieving pass the pedlars o’er the hill</p>
<p class='line0'>With the treasures in their bundles, but to leave us questing still.</p>
<p class='line0'>Mystic fires horizons redden, but each crimson flash in turn</p>
<p class='line0'>Only lights the empty places in the bracken and the fern;</p>
<p class='line0'>So in after years I’ve proved it, spite of pedant, crank, and fool,</p>
<p class='line0'>Very much the way I found it at the old bush school.</p>

<p class='line0'>Out to the road with a shout we’d fly</p>
<p class='line0'>To gape at the elephants trudging by,</p>
<p class='line0'>And our hearts beat fast and our hopes ran high,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As we followed it up and down;</p>
<p class='line0'>For nought in the air, the sea, or sky</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;So after the show we went,</p>
<p class='line0'>And we got in the way of the men when they</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Were rigging the circus tent,</p>
<p class='line0'>And we knew that we stood on holy ground,</p>
<p class='line0'>As we followed an empty van around—</p>
<p class='line0'>And got for ourselves a belting sound,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Which a charm to the business lent.</p>
<p class='line0'>But we wagged it from school behind the pound,</p>
<p class='line0'>Till some Jack Pudding our shelter found</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When the circus came to town,</p>
<p class='line0'>We swallowed hot tea with tears of glee,</p>

<p class='line0'>We took quite the full of our shilling’s worth,</p>

<p class='line0'>Or yelled in a salvo of noisy mirth</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;At the tricks of the painted clown.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, wondrous thoughts in our minds had birth,</p>
<p class='line0'>And we felt that the band was the best on earth,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We fondly recalled the scene,</p>
<p class='line0'>Horses that pranced, and eyes entranced,</p>

<p class='line0'>The mule, and the monkey, and tall giraffe,</p>
<p class='line0'>The “juggerlin’-man” with his magic staff,</p>
<p class='line0'>The girl who went round with her photograph</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(And oh, but we thought her a queen!)</p>
<p class='line0'>We started a show on our own behalf,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Performed” on the back of a poddy calf,</p>

<p class='line0'>And the elephants trudge as they trudged of yore,</p>

<p class='line0'>And pointing always to the sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It stood upon the hill.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And through our lives in wondrous ways</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Its holy purpose led</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For when the Holy Morning strung</p>

<p class='line0'>You’d see us driving—old and young—</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On every road to Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It brought the brave young mother there,</p>

<p class='line0'>To wrap their tiny hearts in prayer,</p>
<p class='line0'>And teach them how to cast their care</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Upon the Holy Rood.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It watched the little bush girl grow,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Old Father Pat! They’ll tell you still with mingled love and pride</p>
<p class='line0'>Of stirring deeds that live and thrill the quiet country-side;</p>
<p class='line0'>And when they praise his <span class='it'>tours-de-force</span>, be sure it won’t be long</p>
<p class='line0'>Before they talk about his horse—the old gray Currajong.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For twenty years he drove him through the bush and round the town,</p>
<p class='line0'>Until the old white stager knew the parish upside down;</p>
<p class='line0'>He’d take his time, and calculate, and have his wilful way,</p>
<p class='line0'>And stop at every Catholic gate to bid them all good day.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But well I mind the stories told when Father Pat was young—</p>
<p class='line0'>At least, when he was not so old—his scattered flock among;</p>
<p class='line0'>When health and strength were on his side, you’d see him swing along</p>
<p class='line0'>With that clean, easy, sweeping stride that marked old Currajong.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Through all the years he ne’er was late the second Mass to say,</p>
<p class='line0'>And twenty miles he’d “duplicate,” and pass us on the way.</p>
<p class='line0'>Hard-held and beating clean tattoos, the old gray, stepping kind,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like gravel from his twinkling shoes would fling the miles behind.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And often some too daring lad, a turn of speed to show,</p>
<p class='line0'>Would straighten up his sleepy prad and give the priest a “go”;</p>
<p class='line0'>But, faith, he found what others found, and held the lesson long,</p>
<p class='line0'>That nothing in the country round could move with Currajong.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And, oh, the din! and, oh, the fuss! mere words were vain to tell</p>
<p class='line0'>Of how they stopped the night with us; and don’t I mind it well?</p>
<p class='line0'>The boree log ablaze “inside,” and gay with rug and mat;</p>
<p class='line0'>The “front-room,” to the world denied, made snug for Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We knew his distant hoof-beats; ay, and grief they could forebode;</p>
<p class='line0'>So, when we heard a horse go by, clean-stepping down the road,</p>
<p class='line0'>Round many a log-fire burning bright there passed the word along,</p>
<p class='line0'>“There’s someone sick and sore the night; I’ll bet that’s Currajong.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Whereat you’d hear the old men tell—perhaps a trifle add—</p>
<p class='line0'>Of some sick-call remembered well, when “so-and-so took bad.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“You couldn’t see your hand in front.” “ ’Twas rainin’ pitchforks, too.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“The doctor jibbed, to put it blunt—but Father Pat went through.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ay, he went through in shine or shade; so, when the days were fair,</p>
<p class='line0'>And at our simple sports we played, ’twas good to see him there;</p>
<p class='line0'>And under troubled, angry skies, when all the world went wrong,</p>
<p class='line0'>With aching hearts and misted eyes we watched for Currajong.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We watched, and never watched in vain, whatever might befall.</p>
<p class='line0'>When summoned to the bed of pain, he answered to the call.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He came through rain or storm or heat; and in the darkest night</p>
<p class='line0'>We heard his hoofs the music beat, we saw the welcome light.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And when again, with plumes ahead and horses stepping slow,</p>
<p class='line0'>We followed on, behind our dead, the road all men must go,</p>
<p class='line0'>A loitering line, with knots and gaps, the funeral passed along,</p>
<p class='line0'>And half a mile of lurching traps was led by Currajong.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But, as the good priest older grew, and aches and troubles came,</p>
<p class='line0'>His buggy and the white horse, too, were stricken much the same.</p>
<p class='line0'>The springs went down the side he sat, and altar-boys and such</p>
<p class='line0'>Kept sliding in on Father Pat, and woke him at the touch.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Then, pensioned off at last and done, a sorry thing it stood,</p>
<p class='line0'>With sagging cobwebs round it spun, and nest-eggs in the hood.</p>
<p class='line0'>Just once a year it lived again, and groaned and creaked along</p>
<p class='line0'>To fetch the bishop from the train with limping Currajong.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ah, newer methods, younger men! the times are moving fast,</p>
<p class='line0'>And but in dreams we tread again the wheel-ruts of the past;</p>
<p class='line0'>The eyes are filmed that watched of old, the kindly hearts are still,</p>
<p class='line0'>And silent tombstones white and cold are glimmering on the hill.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>While scorching up the road, belike, with singing gears alive</p>
<p class='line0'>The curate on his motor-bike hits up his forty-five;</p>
<p class='line0'>But tender, tingling memories swell, and love will linger long</p>
<p class='line0'>In all the stirring yarns they tell about Old Currajong.</p>

<p class='line0'>Yes, that’s the hardest hand at all upon my frosted head—</p>
<p class='line0'>That telegram that brought the news that Father Pat is dead—</p>
<p class='line0'>I cannot grip its message yet; we were such cronies, that</p>
<p class='line0'>The world is not a world to-night without poor Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Nigh eighty years I’ve known him now. Since ever we were boys</p>
<p class='line0'>Across the sea in Ireland, each other’s cares and joys</p>
<p class='line0'>We’ve shared as with their leaden step they strode across the mat;</p>
<p class='line0'>The kindest heart that ever beat is stilled in Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>They knew him round the country wide; from here to Carrathool</p>
<p class='line0'>The teamster toiling by his dray, the youngsters home from school,</p>
<p class='line0'>Would greet him with a curt “good day,” and shyly pull the hat</p>
<p class='line0'>Down farther on the forehead in respect for Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I see him in my mind to-night, a diamond in the rough,</p>
<p class='line0'>A kindly soul that hid the gold, but showed the sterner stuff—</p>
<p class='line0'>The wise old eye, the homely face, the scant hairs pasted flat</p>
<p class='line0'>Across the wide wise baldness of the head of Father Pat;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The collar caught with honest tape when fleeting studs had gone;</p>
<p class='line0'>The suit that said good-bye to cut the day he put it on;</p>
<p class='line0'>The handsome stock the sisters built, the tassels on the hat,</p>
<p class='line0'>The stout umbrella in the hand of manly Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I see the ordered sitting-room he’ll never enter more,</p>
<p class='line0'>The ivory bead-crowned crucifix, the font behind the door,</p>
<p class='line0'>The parish books, the registers and, handy where he sat,</p>
<p class='line0'>The well-thumbed breviary that warmed the heart of Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A man of method all the time—the pigeon-holes a-line,</p>
<p class='line0'>A dozen keys upon a chain, his pockets filled with twine.</p>
<p class='line0'>His actions told the time of day, and rivalled e’en in that</p>
<p class='line0'>The sober clock that ticked away the life of Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He used to run the curate on the lines he ran himself;</p>
<p class='line0'>A list of parish duties stood upon the mantel-shelf,</p>
<p class='line0'>As binding as the decalogue, so all-embracing that</p>
<p class='line0'>The bishop had to keep the step, when guest of Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He’d argue till the cows came home, and never know a doubt;</p>
<p class='line0'>But when he “showed the p’liteness,” it was then, my boy, look out!</p>
<p class='line0'>He’d lay the shoneen<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> by the heels, and shake him like a rat;</p>
<p class='line0'>He wasn’t worth a straw, bedad, when trimmed by Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>His sermons were tremendous things, and thunder-bolts would drop;</p>
<p class='line0'>The trouble with poor Father Pat was when and how to stop.</p>
<p class='line0'>Theology? don’t mention it! he’d talk the bishop flat;</p>
<p class='line0'>One half was Father Gury, and the rest was Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I’d quoted him so often to the young lads round about</p>
<p class='line0'>To show that we old fellows still were far from petered out,</p>
<p class='line0'>Could take a hand at ceremonies, could sing a Mass and that;</p>
<p class='line0'>So when we had a big day here I called on Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He came—but didn’t conquer, faith, though every nerve was strained;</p>
<p class='line0'>He’d waved his hand to rubrics on the day he was ordained;</p>
<p class='line0'>He went along his old, old way in broken notes and flat—</p>
<p class='line0'>To tell the truth, I felt ashamed for once of Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>These young lads build their castles up, and fancy’s beacons glow.</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah well, poor Father Pat and I went through that years ago;</p>
<p class='line0'>And some of those ideals are dead, and some we’ve jested at,</p>
<p class='line0'>And some are where the failures wait for me and Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Though brighter far the morning seems than does the setting sun,</p>
<p class='line0'>Still, they but carry on the work by such as us begun.</p>
<p class='line0'>We blazed the tracks they tread to-day—at least they’ll grant us that—</p>
<p class='line0'>The men who sailed in sixty-five along with Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We left the friendly stars astern, the Irish lights agleam,</p>
<p class='line0'>We dared the seas in sailing-ships before the days of steam,</p>
<p class='line0'>We faced a weird wild waste of world that brave men trembled at:</p>
<p class='line0'>No shipside welcome met the men who came with Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We turned our horses’ heads out west, beyond the farthest track,</p>
<p class='line0'>With nothing but an alien star to light the journey back.</p>
<p class='line0'>The echoes mocked us as we went, and silence startled sat</p>
<p class='line0'>When out beyond the rim of things we marched with Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We said our Mass in canvas tents, and neath the gnarléd trees;</p>
<p class='line0'>Of red-gum slabs and sheets of bark we built our sanctuaries;</p>
<p class='line0'>Our axes rang on timbered slopes above the mining flat,</p>
<p class='line0'>And church and school and convent mark the path of Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We made our bow to wild and waste, and hardships worse than those;</p>
<p class='line0'>We leave a gracious golden land that blossoms like the rose.</p>
<p class='line0'>Far defter hands may now adorn the work we laboured at,</p>
<p class='line0'>But granite base and buttressed wall were built by Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Well may his arms drop idly down at eighty years of age;</p>
<p class='line0'>His story goes behind him with no stain upon its page.</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ll bet he played the innings through and carried out his bat,</p>
<p class='line0'>And none dare hint “retiring hurt” in front of Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And with him goes the little band that sailed in sixty-five;</p>
<p class='line0'>A dreamer by his lamp to-night is all that’s left alive.</p>
<p class='line0'>Poor Father James, and Father Ned, and jovial Father Mat</p>
<p class='line0'>Are waiting out beyond the dark to welcome Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I’ll not attend the obsequies: I feel I could not face</p>
<p class='line0'>The office that I know so well, and see his vacant place:</p>
<p class='line0'>We saw a generation pass while side by side we sat:</p>
<p class='line0'>Another starts its march to-day—without us, Father Pat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>They’ll wonder why I am not there—I, last of all the band—</p>
<p class='line0'>To take farewell of him that’s gone; but he will understand.</p>
<p class='line0'>We’ll have a little requiem my own loved altar at,</p>
<p class='line0'>And just ourselves—alive and dead—shall chant it, Father Pat.</p>

<p class='line0'>Since Death’s hard summons robbed me of the sterling old machine,</p>
<p class='line0'>That wore out in my service here—my faithful Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Poor Josephine, she knew me well—and, faith, she ought to know;</p>
<p class='line0'>For since the bishop sent me here, some thirty years ago,</p>
<p class='line0'>My one and only manager, my right-hand man she’d been;</p>
<p class='line0'>I never had a word against my trusted Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She pottered round the place herself for thirty years and more—</p>
<p class='line0'>This new one has a thuckeen now to sweep and mind the door</p>
<p class='line0'>And entertain with parish chat each gossiping voteen<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a></p>
<p class='line0'>She’d have no thuckeen near the place, would crabbéd Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>They tell me this one’s up-to-date—too up-to-date for me;</p>
<p class='line0'>I tremble at her polished floors, and modern cookery,</p>
<p class='line0'>The old man finds the old ways best—old springs were twice as green—</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ve heard His Lordship praise the stews of clever Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>My study was my sanctum once—a castle all my own—</p>
<p class='line0'>But this one with her natty ways can’t leave the place alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>Her fingers ache to tidy up; and, when she’s extra clean,</p>
<p class='line0'>I sit a stranger in my room and sigh for Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She says that table’s “awful” and it drives her to despair;</p>
<p class='line0'>Perhaps it does, but method’s in what seems confusion there—</p>
<p class='line0'>I know where every paper is, each book and magazine.</p>
<p class='line0'>That jumbled pile was sacred in the eyes of Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>This new one hides my things away in pigeon-hole and drawer,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, faith, she does her job so well, they’re lost for evermore.</p>
<p class='line0'>She’ll have to learn to let things be as they have ever been—</p>
<p class='line0'>Just make the bed, and sweep the floor, the same as Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And yet no sthreel was Josephine, for quick was she to note</p>
<p class='line0'>My native country’s colour coming gently through my coat;</p>
<p class='line0'>I teased her—said she ought to like the wearing of the green;</p>
<p class='line0'>She couldn’t see a joke at all, poor, solemn Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She used to hide my battered hats; my old birettas, too,</p>
<p class='line0'>Just when I had them broken in, would disappear from view.</p>
<p class='line0'>I wondered where my wardrobe went, until by chance I’d seen</p>
<p class='line0'>A tramp in full pontificals subscribed by Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I mind the time the bishop came, one day in early spring.</p>
<p class='line0'>We brought him round to see the school, and hear the children sing;</p>
<p class='line0'>Bedad, I was a toff that day; you’d think I was a dean,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or some commercial traveller—my thanks to Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>My coat was pressed, just like a swell’s; the breeches that I wore</p>
<p class='line0'>Had creases in them fore and aft like new ones from the store.</p>
<p class='line0'>I smelt like some old motor-car, exuding kerosene;</p>
<p class='line0'>I noted, too, the furtive glance of anxious Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She watched His Lordship’s portly form pass proudly o’er the mat,</p>
<p class='line0'>His Majesty the curate next, with gloves and shiny hat;</p>
<p class='line0'>I’d stuck an old biretta on, that better days had seen;</p>
<p class='line0'>She came and dragged it off my head—ah, wisha, Josephine!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It sometimes strikes me, now she’s gone, she’d no drawbacks at all:</p>
<p class='line0'>Her features just a shade severe, her age canonical,</p>
<p class='line0'>In fashions of her mother’s day she trod her way serene,</p>
<p class='line0'>And wasteful ways of worldly dames disgusted Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She knew the place from back to front, she knew the parish through,</p>
<p class='line0'>And those who never went to Mass, and those who did, she knew;</p>
<p class='line0'>The hours arranged for this and that—she had the whole routine—</p>
<p class='line0'>And oftentimes to ease a doubt I went to Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She thought I couldn’t make mistakes, not even if I tried;</p>
<p class='line0'>She felt the Holy Ghost would send a mitre ere I died;</p>
<p class='line0'>She lay in wait for wagging tongues—and, faith, her own was keen;</p>
<p class='line0'>God help the one who dared complain in front of Josephine!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The people called her “curate,” yes, and “bishop” too, I hear;</p>
<p class='line0'>They even called her “parish-priest”—in disrespect, I fear.</p>
<p class='line0'>They told me that she’d “roon” the church—too long with me she’d been;</p>
<p class='line0'>But only death could give the sack to faithful Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ah, soft and sweet be sleep to her who friendless trod her track</p>
<p class='line0'>Along the beaten road of life that knows no turning back.</p>
<p class='line0'>I marked the splendid Irish faith that met the closing scene,</p>
<p class='line0'>And heard the beat of angels’ wings that came for Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She’s in her lonely grave to-night beneath the Murray pines,</p>
<p class='line0'>And haply in their breeze-swept song a requiem divines:</p>
<p class='line0'>The people raised a little stone to keep her memory green,</p>
<p class='line0'>And handed to the winds and rain the name of Josephine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>How quickly have the days gone by! she’s dead—now, let me see—</p>
<p class='line0'>She’s dead twelve months: to-morrow is her anniversary:</p>
<p class='line0'>Now who’s the Saint to-morrow? Ah, a semi—“Hedwig, Queen.”</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ll use the black—and may God rest the soul of Josephine!</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I can see it in my dreaming o’er a gap of thirty years,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the rattle of its boxes still is music in my ears:</p>
<p class='line0'>With a bow to family vanity it rises from the past</p>
<p class='line0'>As the pride of the selection where my humble youth was cast.</p>
<p class='line0'>It was fashioned in a nightmare by some wandering genius,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it wasn’t quite a waggon, and it wasn’t quite a ’bus;</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas an old four-wheeled gazabo that was something in between,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the wheels were painted yellow, and the rest was painted green</p>
<p class='line0'>(It would waken lively interest in the antiquarian)</p>
<p class='line0'>And ’twas known to all the country as the Old Mass Shandrydan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It did duty on a week-day in a dozen ways and more,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it seemed just made to order for whate’er ’twas wanted for;</p>
<p class='line0'>It would cart the chaff to market, carry wood and hay in turn,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the neighbours in rotation used to cadge the old concern.</p>
<p class='line0'>But the Sundays we were due for Mass would cancel every loan,</p>
<p class='line0'>For the Little Irish Mother then would claim it for her own.</p>
<p class='line0'>She inspected it the day before (and criticized it, too),</p>
<p class='line0'>And the ten of us were set to work to make it look like new.</p>
<p class='line0'>There was one to every yellow wheel—ay, one to every spoke;</p>
<p class='line0'>One to nail a piece of hardwood on the part “them Careys” broke:</p>
<p class='line0'>Another from the floor of it the chips and straw would rake,</p>
<p class='line0'>While the Dad went searching rubbish-heaps for old boots for the brake:</p>
<p class='line0'>So we rubbed and scrubbed and hammered up, and beat the rattertan</p>
<p class='line0'>Till it stood in all its glory as the Old Mass Shandrydan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>When at last, with velvet sandals shod, the Holy Morning crept</p>
<p class='line0'>Through the mists above The Sugarloaf, that silent vigil kept</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er a little old slab dwelling which the years have brushed away,</p>
<p class='line0'>You would hear the Little Mother stirring round before the day,</p>
<p class='line0'>Rousing sleepy heads from blankets, washing faces, doing hair,</p>
<p class='line0'>Scolding, coaxing, bustling, breathless in her hurry everywhere.</p>
<p class='line0'>Half the night before she laboured, and we’d hear her come and go</p>
<p class='line0'>With the Sunday suits of “reach-me-downs” to place them in a row.</p>
<p class='line0'>There was this to patch, and that to darn, and something else to mend;</p>
<p class='line0'>She would see to every single thing before her work would end,</p>
<p class='line0'>To the dresses and the pinnies—oh, the memory she had!—</p>
<p class='line0'>There were lace-up boots for Morgan, and a clean white shirt for Dad.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the hubbub and the murder that the household used to make,</p>
<p class='line0'>When she had us tumbled out of bed, and painfully awake.</p>
<p class='line0'>Here a voice in anguish lifted to announce a button gone;</p>
<p class='line0'>Someone calling from the back-room “Mum, what socks will I put on?”</p>
<p class='line0'>While “Himself” was like a Bolshevik athirst for human blood,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shouting “Mother,” as he wrastled with a fractious collar-stud.</p>
<p class='line0'>But she kept the tumult under till she had us spick and span,</p>
<p class='line0'>Packed like pickles in a bottle in the Old Mass Shandrydan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We had ten good miles to drive to Mass—and Mass was sharp at eight;</p>
<p class='line0'>But we’d never hear the end of it if something kept us late;</p>
<p class='line0'>So we started ere the morning hung its bunting in the sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the kookaburras chortled as we rumbled slowly by.</p>
<p class='line0'>For the frost was on the barley, and the rime was on the trees,</p>
<p class='line0'>And our little faces smarted with the whip-lash of the breeze,</p>
<p class='line0'>Still we watched the branches redden to the first kiss of the sun</p>
<p class='line0'>And we counted all the cart-wheels that the busy spiders spun,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then the magpies sang to greet us, and our little hearts began</p>
<p class='line0'>To forget that we were shivering in the Old Mass Shandrydan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>So the old contraption lumbered, safely towed, as Dad knew how,</p>
<p class='line0'>By a pair of hefty elephants promoted from the plough,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it rattled like a saw-mill, and it thundered like a dray;</p>
<p class='line0'>Faith, you’d hear the circus coming a half-a-dozen miles away!</p>
<p class='line0'>All along the road the neighbours used to take the time from us,</p>
<p class='line0'>For they never made a start until they heard our omnibus;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then a shrill soprano shouted, “Put the horses in the van,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Them’s The Sugarloaf O’Briens in the Old Mass Shandrydan.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We were first to Carey’s Crossing, first to reach Moloney’s Mill,</p>
<p class='line0'>But the opposition caught us as we laboured up the hill;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then the air became electric as they tried to pass us by,</p>
<p class='line0'>For “Himself” for family reasons (which I needn’t specify)</p>
<p class='line0'>Kept the road in deadly earnest, and would never seem to hear</p>
<p class='line0'>The abuse of the procession that was gathering in the rear.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, they whistled and they shouted till their feelings overflowed,</p>
<p class='line0'>But the old man in the Dreadnought was the master of the road.</p>
<p class='line0'>It was suicide to bump it, and the horses wouldn’t shy,</p>
<p class='line0'>So he trundled on before them with a bad look in his eye.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then, as suddenly the whistling and the bantering shouting ceased</p>
<p class='line0'>And a solemn hush denoted the arrival of the priest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Would a fine “good Catholic” thunder “Yerra, shame upon you, man!</p>
<p class='line0'>Pull one side there, Pat O’Brien, with your Old Mass Shandrydan.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Pull! Bedad, he’d pull the town down when His Reverence hove in sight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Pulled his hat off with the left hand, and pipe out with the right;</p>
<p class='line0'>Pulled his family in the gutter, pulled the horses off their feet,</p>
<p class='line0'>And a shower of small O’Briens went skedaddling from the seat.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then they rattled loudly past us, and a wild stampede began,</p>
<p class='line0'>For they all had family reasons to outpace the other man.</p>
<p class='line0'>There were buggies, traps, and turnouts there of every shape and rig;</p>
<p class='line0'>There were Murphys in a spring-cart, and the Caseys in a gig;</p>
<p class='line0'>There were Barnes’ ponies pounding twixt a gallop and a trot,</p>
<p class='line0'>While the Careys with their pacing-mare went sailing past the lot.</p>
<p class='line0'>Faith, we had it in for Carey, and our disrespect increased</p>
<p class='line0'>At the cheek of “them there Careys who would try to beat the priest.”</p>
<p class='line0'>No, we wouldn’t stoop to things like that; we’d act the gentleman</p>
<p class='line0'>Half a mile behind the others in the Old Mass Shandrydan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It’s a long way back I’m gazing, and the stage has changed since then;</p>
<p class='line0'>Just an echo finds me sometimes, bringing back the scene again.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, the heart beats slower measure than it used to beat, alas,</p>
<p class='line0'>When a Little Irish Mother dressed us all in time for Mass.</p>
<p class='line0'>I have lounged in fast expresses, I have travelled first saloon,</p>
<p class='line0'>I have heard the haunting music that the winds and waters croon,</p>
<p class='line0'>I have seen the road careering from a whirring motor-car,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the Careys couldn’t pass us, or our sense of fitness jar;</p>
<p class='line0'>But the world is somehow smaller, somehow less enchanting than</p>
<p class='line0'>When I saw it o’er the tail-board of the Old Mass Shandrydan.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The congregation stood about,</p>

<p class='line0'>Faith, and little Miss McCroddie was the tidy little body,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Just as trim and prim and handy as you’d ever wish to see</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(She was well upon the weather-beaten side of thirty-three);</p>
<p class='line0'>And she’d chuckle and she’d titter when the people used to twit her</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On the most pronounced attentions of one Lanty Hallissey</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(Now this Lanty was a bachelor of some antiquity).</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Well, he’d said good-bye to fifty; he was solemn, he was thrifty,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And he’d come to Mass each Sunday decorated handsomely</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(With an eye upon the Tidy Little Body, don’t you see);</p>
<p class='line0'>And you’d see him titivated in a much abbreviated</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Kind o’ sort o’ style of swallow-tail that flogged him viciously</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(Which it needed the judicious use of treacle at the knee);</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And his hat was like a Quaker’s; but some fifteen hundred acres</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;More than evened up the lee-way of the said deficiency</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(Faith, he had a tidy cottage on the little property).</p>
<p class='line0'>So, when Mass at length was over, round his jinker he would hover,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;While the women teased the Tidy Little Body merrily</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(And my hero was unconscious of their jesting, homely glee);</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There he’d fool about, and truckle with a strap or with a buckle,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And tighten this, and loosen that, a-gammon he do be</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(With the eye out for the Tidy Little Body, don’t you see).</p>
<p class='line0'>And the more they used to tease her, well, the more it seemed to please her;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And she wriggled and she giggled, and she tittered girlishly—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Oh, it’s all so very silly. Picture Mr. Hallissey!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>

<p class='line0'>Somethin’ swellin’ out responsive to the flattery of the starin’,</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the little groups discussin’ parish gossip round the door.</p>
<p class='line0'>What if through the workin’ week-days, fame his humble labours scornin’,</p>
<p class='line0'>He is just a common mortal whom the stains of toil besmirch,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ay, the Pillar of the Church is he, and woe to them who’d doubt him;</p>
<p class='line0'>Faith, he’d put them to the right-about, and face them to the rear,</p>
<p class='line0'>For it’s never parish-priest there’s been could carry on without him,</p>
<p class='line0'>Since St. Michael’s been a parish church—it’s goin’ on fifty year.</p>
<p class='line0'>Don’t we see him time and time again, the chest of him expandin’,</p>
<p class='line0'>Superintendin’ things that matter not, and things that matter much?</p>
<p class='line0'>Don’t we see him with “the gentlemen,” the officer commandin’,</p>
<p class='line0'>Every Christmas Day and Easter writin’ down the names and such?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ain’t he present all occasions when there’s grave deliberatin’</p>
<p class='line0'>On important parish matters at the school or presbyt’ry?</p>
<p class='line0'>With the eyes of him a-blinkin’ and the wisdom radiatin’—</p>
<p class='line0'>He, the sole survivin’ member of the first church “Komitee”?</p>
<p class='line0'>And maintainin’ which distinction, don’t it make stonewallin’ sweeter?—</p>
<p class='line0'>And a heap of “argyfyin’ ” cannot shift him from his perch—</p>
<p class='line0'>Don’t he tell them how they did things in the time of Father Peter?</p>
<p class='line0'>Faith, he shows ’em there’s a kick left in the Pillar of the Church.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Sure the Pillar of the Church it was that saved the situation,</p>
<p class='line0'>“With the whole of ’em agin him,” as I’ve often heard him tell;</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas he “seen the danger comin’,” he that “med the suggestation.”</p>
<p class='line0'>He that “druv ’em to their rat-holes,” where he shook ’em good and well.</p>
<p class='line0'>He’s the Pillar of the Church, bedad, and never shy or shrinkin’,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor afraid to be upstandin’ his opinions for to state.</p>
<p class='line0'>Times the priest he’s flabbergasted; once he set the bishop thinkin’;</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Och, ’twould do you good to hear him, with an “audjunce” round him gawkin’,</p>

<p class='line0'>And the failure starin’ at ’em, had he left ’em in the lurch;</p>
<p class='line0'>Times and times he travelled with ’em, and “tremenjus” was the drivin’—</p>
<p class='line0'>Pshaw, a hundred miles was larkin’ to the Pillar of the Church.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ay, the Pillar of the Church is he; and still at Mass or meetin’</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s the crabbed old bald head of him, conspicuous to the view.</p>
<p class='line0'>And at answerin’ up the prayers betimes the voice of him competin’</p>
<p class='line0'>With its thunders shames the thin attempts of others in the pew;</p>
<p class='line0'>See the poisonous little face of him at Cooney’s baby screechin’,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the twistin’ and the glarin’, and then listenin’ like a hare</p>
<p class='line0'>While His Reverence reads the notices—but plottin’ through the preachin’</p>
<p class='line0'>For to get a kick at Murphy’s dog, that’s ramblin’ everywhere.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Times and times he’s “riz their dander”—every member up agin him—</p>
<p class='line0'>And the jealous call him “Curate,” while the flippant call him “Pope”;</p>
<p class='line0'>But he doesn’t care a “thraneen,” for “the venyum” isn’t in him,</p>
<p class='line0'>Happy just to be a leader where the lesser spirits grope,</p>
<p class='line0'>Priests have come and priests have left us; change has blown from every quarter;</p>
<p class='line0'>Him alone the grim marauder ne’er has chanced on in the search;</p>
<p class='line0'>But we’d miss him were he taken, as we’d miss the holy water—</p>
<p class='line0'>He’s the feature of the Sunday, is the Pillar of the Church.</p>

<p class='line0'>Now of all the old sinners in mischief immersed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;From the ages of Gog and Magog,</p>
<p class='line0'>At the top of the list, from the last to the first,</p>
<p class='line0'>And by every good soul in the parish accursed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Is that scamp of a Presbyt’ry Dog.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He’s a hairy old scoundrel as ugly as sin,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He’s a demon that travels incog.,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a classical name, and an ignorant grin,</p>
<p class='line0'>And a tail, by the way, that is scraggy and thin,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the rest of him merely a dog.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He is like a young waster of fortune possessed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As he rambles the town at a jog;</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It’s unfit for a Presbyt’ry Dog.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He is out on the street at the sound of a fight,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With the eyes on him standing agog,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the scut of a tail—well, bedad, it’s a fright;</p>
<p class='line0'>Faith, you’d give him a kick that would set him alight,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>His rotundity now to absurdity runs,</p>

<p class='line0'>When it’s time for a meal, and goes off to the nuns,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Who’re deceived in the Presbyt’ry Dog.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>When he follows the priest to the bush, there is war.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He inspects the whole place at a jog,</p>
<p class='line0'>And he puts on great airs and fine antics galore,</p>
<p class='line0'>While he chases the sheep till we’re after his gore,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Though he may be the Presbyt’ry Dog.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>’Twas last Sunday a dog in the church went ahead</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With an ill-bred and loud monologue,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the priest said some things that would shiver the dead,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I’m with him in every last word that he said—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Ah, but wait—’twas the Presbyt’ry Dog.</p>

<p class='line0'>The bishop sat in lordly state and purple cap sublime,</p>
<p class='line0'>And galvanized the old bush church at Confirmation time;</p>
<p class='line0'>And all the kids were mustered up from fifty miles around,</p>
<p class='line0'>With Sunday clothes, and staring eyes, and ignorance profound.</p>
<p class='line0'>Now was it fate, or was it grace, whereby they yarded too</p>
<p class='line0'>An overgrown two-storey lad from Tangmalangaloo?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A hefty son of virgin soil, where nature has her fling,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The bishop summed the youngsters up, as bishops only can;</p>
<p class='line0'>He cast a searching glance around, then fixed upon his man.</p>
<p class='line0'>But glum and dumb and undismayed through every bout he sat;</p>
<p class='line0'>He seemed to think that he was there, but wasn’t sure of that.</p>
<p class='line0'>The bishop gave a scornful look, as bishops sometimes do,</p>
<p class='line0'>And glared right through the pagan in from Tangmalangaloo.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Come, tell me, boy,” his lordship said in crushing tones severe,</p>

<p class='line0'>“And send a name upon a card to those who’re far away?</p>
<p class='line0'>“Why is it wandering ones return with smiles and greetings, too?”</p>
<p class='line0'>A squall of knowledge hit the lad from Tangmalangaloo.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He gave a lurch which set a-shake the vases on the shelf,</p>
<p class='line0'>He knocked the benches all askew, up-ending of himself.</p>
<p class='line0'>And oh, how pleased his lordship was, and how he smiled to say,</p>
<p class='line0'>“That’s good, my boy. Come, tell me now; and what is Christmas Day?”</p>
<p class='line0'>The ready answer bared a fact no bishop ever knew—</p>

<p class='line0'>’Twas right and just to him to trust</p>

<p class='line0'>To serve the priest; and here at least</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He never proved defaulter;</p>

<p class='line0'>In dread, I wot (he once was “cot”),</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The priest might not be comin’:</p>
<p class='line0'>Then, stepping slow on heel and toe,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;No more he’d fail or falter,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He’d move about the Altar.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There’s a weather-beaten sign-post where the track turns towards the west,</p>
<p class='line0'>Through the tall, white, slender timber, in the land I love the best.</p>
<p class='line0'>Short its message is—“To Casey’s”—for it points the road to Casey’s;</p>
<p class='line0'>And my homing heart goes bushwards on an idle roving quest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Down the old, old road contented, o’er the gum-leaves crisp and scented,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where a deft hand splashed the purple on the big hill’s sombre crest.</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah, it’s long, long years and dreary, many, many steps and weary,</p>
<p class='line0'>Back to where the lingering dew of morn bedecked the barley-grass,</p>
<p class='line0'>When I watched the wild careering of the neighbours through the clearing</p>
<p class='line0'>Down that sweet bush track to Casey’s, o’er the paddock down to Casey’s;</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For, as soon as Mass was over, round the church they swarmed like bees,</p>
<p class='line0'>Filled their pipes and duly lit them, brushed the dust from off their knees;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then they’d “ready-up” for Casey’s—self-invited down to Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Harness horses for the women with a bushman’s careless ease.</p>
<p class='line0'>With a neat spring to the saddle, soon would start the wild skedaddle,</p>
<p class='line0'>Passing gigs and traps and buggies packed as tight as they could squeeze;</p>
<p class='line0'>Hearts as buoyant as a feather in the mellow autumn weather,</p>
<p class='line0'>While the noisy minahs cheered to see the glad procession pass—</p>
<p class='line0'>All the Regans and the Ryans, and the whole mob of O’Briens</p>
<p class='line0'>Bringing up the rear to Casey’s—in the Shandrydan to Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Past the kitchen door they rattled and they took the horses out;</p>
<p class='line0'>While the women went inside at once, the menfolk hung about</p>
<p class='line0'>Round the stable down at Casey’s, waiting dinner down at Casey’s;</p>
<p class='line0'>And they talked about the Government, and blamed it for the drought,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sitting where the sunlight lingers, picking splinters from their fingers,</p>
<p class='line0'>Settling all the problems of the world beyond a chance of doubt.</p>
<p class='line0'>From inside there came the bustle of the cheerful wholesome hustle,</p>
<p class='line0'>As dear old Mrs. Casey tried all records to surpass;</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, there’s many a memory blesses her sweet silver-braided tresses;</p>
<p class='line0'>They were “lovely” down at Casey’s—always joking down at Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>So they called us in to dinner, five-and-twenty guests—and more—</p>
<p class='line0'>At the longest kitchen-table ever stood upon a floor.</p>
<p class='line0'>There was plenty down at Casey’s—ay, an open house was Casey’s,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the neighbour and his missus never, never passed the door;</p>
<p class='line0'>Where they counted kindly giving half the joy and pride of living</p>
<p class='line0'>And the seasons came full-handed, and the angels blessed the store;</p>
<p class='line0'>While the happy Laughing Mary flitted round us like a fairy.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the big, shy boys stopped business, and looked up to watch her pass—</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah, but when she caught them staring at the ribbons she was wearing!</p>
<p class='line0'>Well, they spilled their tea at Casey’s—on the good clean cloth at Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Then the reckless feats of daring, and the bushman’s fierce delight</p>
<p class='line0'>When the brumby squealed and rooted, and the saddle-girths were tight!</p>
<p class='line0'>They could ride ’em down at Casey’s—stick like plasters down at Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>When they noticed Mary looking, they would go with all their might;</p>
<p class='line0'>Ho! they belted, and they clouted, and they yelled, and whooped, and shouted,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Riding flash” to “ketch” the ladies, spurring, flogging, left and right!</p>
<p class='line0'>And the lad with manners airy risked his neck for Laughing Mary</p>
<p class='line0'>When he summoned all his courage up a rival to surpass;</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, the fun went fast and faster, as he landed in disaster</p>
<p class='line0'>In the puddle-hole at Casey’s—with his brand new suit at Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Hoary, hale, bewhiskered veterans, perched like mopokes in a row,</p>
<p class='line0'>Out of danger on the top-rail, gave advice to those below;</p>
<p class='line0'>They were wonders down at Casey’s, were the old men at the Caseys’—</p>
<p class='line0'>They’re the boys could ride the “bad ’uns” in the days of long ago!</p>
<p class='line0'>Faith, and old man Casey told ’em of a way he had to hold ’em.</p>
<p class='line0'>Man, “the deuce an outlaw thrun him,” when he “got a proper show”;</p>
<p class='line0'>Ay, and each man “upped and showed ’em” how he “handled ’em, an’ rode ’em”—</p>
<p class='line0'>Pshaw! there never was a native these old riders could outclass.</p>
<p class='line0'>Once again they were “among ’em,” and they “roped ’em” and they “slung ’em”</p>
<p class='line0'>On the stockyard fence at Casey’s—smoking, “pitchin’,” down at Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Hard and cold is youth to fancies which around the old men cling;</p>
<p class='line0'>So they left them perched upon the rail to swap their vapouring,</p>
<p class='line0'>Took a seat inside at Casey’s, on the good chairs at the Caseys’;</p>
<p class='line0'>While the Caseys’ new piano made the old house rock and ring.</p>
<p class='line0'>There their mild eyes stared and glistened, as they sat around and listened</p>
<p class='line0'>To the tuneful little ditties Laughing Mary used to sing;</p>
<p class='line0'>There they rubbed their chins and reckoned that to no one was she second—</p>
<p class='line0'>“Cripes, she’d sing the blooming head off any singer in her class!”</p>
<p class='line0'>And the banter and the laughter when the chorus hit the rafter!</p>
<p class='line0'>It was “great” to be at Casey’s—healthy, wholesome fun at Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There was something in the old life which I cannot quite forget;</p>
<p class='line0'>There are happy golden memories that hover round me yet—</p>
<p class='line0'>Something special down at Casey’s, in that wonderland of Casey’s,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the crowfoot and the clover spread a downy coverlet,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the trees seemed always greener, where the life of man was cleaner,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the joys that grew around us shed no leaves of brown regret.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, the merry, merry party! oh, the simple folk and hearty,</p>
<p class='line0'>Who can fling their cares behind them, and forget them while they pass</p>
<p class='line0'>Simple lives and simple pleasure never stinted in the measure.</p>
<p class='line0'>There was something down at Casey’s, something clean and good at Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Passed and gone that old bush homestead where the hours too swiftly flew;</p>
<p class='line0'>Silent now the merry voices of the happy friends I knew;</p>
<p class='line0'>We have drifted far from Casey’s. All deserted now is Casey’s—</p>
<p class='line0'>Just a lone brick chimney standing, and a garden-tree or two.</p>
<p class='line0'>Still the minahs love to linger where the sign-post points the finger</p>
<p class='line0'>Down the bush track winding westward where the tall white timber grew.</p>
<p class='line0'>But the big hill seems to wonder why the ties are snapped asunder,</p>
<p class='line0'>Why the neighbours never gather, never loiter as they pass;</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet a tear-stained thought beseeming comes along and sets me dreaming</p>
<p class='line0'>That I’m back again at Casey’s, with the old, old friends at Casey’s;</p>
<p class='line0'>Spending Sunday down at Casey’s after Mass.</p>

<p class='line0'>’Tis the greatest splash of sunshine right through all my retrospection</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On the days when fairies brought me golden dreams without alloy,</p>
<p class='line0'>When I gazed across the gum-trees round about the old selection</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To the big things far beyond them, with the yearning of a boy.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Drab the little world we lived in; like the sheep, in slow procession</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Down the track along the mountain, went the hours upon their way,</p>
<p class='line0'>Bringing hopes and idle longings that could only find expression</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In the riot of our bounding hearts upon St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There were sports in Casey’s paddock, and the neighbours would assemble</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On the flat below the homestead, where the timber fringed the creek;</p>
<p class='line0'>With Australian skies above them, and Australian trees a-tremble</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the colours of the autumn set in hat and hair and cheek.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Mighty things were done at Casey’s; mighty bouts anticipated</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Made the Sunday church-door topic for a month ahead at least;</p>
<p class='line0'>On the cheerless Sundays after, with misguided hope deflated,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We explained away our failures as we waited for the priest.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>So when morning Mass was over, it was trot and break and canter</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Helter-skelter down to Casey’s, banging, pounding all the way,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the greetings flung in Irish, and the flood of Celtic banter,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the hectic flush of racial pride upon St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Everywhere was emerald flashing from the buggies, traps, and jinkers,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There was green in every garment, and a splash in every hat,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the bows upon the cart-whips, in the ribbons on the winkers,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In the wealth of woven carpet neath the gums on Casey’s Flat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There the new dress faced the critics, and the little beaded bonnet</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the feather flowing freely like a sapling in a gale;</p>
<p class='line0'>And “himself” inside his long black coat that bore a bulge upon it</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Where for twelve forgotten months its weight had hung upon the nail;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And the “splather” of a necktie only once a year paraded,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the scarf that came from Ireland, “ere a one of you were born,”</p>
<p class='line0'>And the treasured bunch of shamrock—old and withered now, and faded,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Blessed by every tear that stained it since the cruel parting morn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Mighty things were done at Casey’s. Men of solid reputation,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Ringing bells and giving orders, kept the programme moving by;</p>
<p class='line0'>And they made you sickly conscious of your humble situation</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When they glared upon your meanness with a cold official eye.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Every “maneen” with a broken voice and backers there beside him,</p>

<p class='line0'>Every nag around the country with a raw bush lad astride him</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Was a racehorse with an Irish name upon St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh, the cheering that betokened those I knew so well competing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With their long legs throwing slip-knots, and the look of men in pain—</p>
<p class='line0'>Put me back into the reach-me-downs, and let me hear the greeting,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Set me loose in Casey’s paddock, where I’d be a boy again!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yes, ’twas good to be a pilgrim in a world that held such wonders,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Though eternal bad behaviour put me neath parental ban,</p>
<p class='line0'>Though the staring, and the wandering, and a score of general blunders</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Got me gaoled behind the taffrail of the Old Mass Shandrydan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Yerra, Johnnie, stop that gawkin.” Is it—with the pulses pumping,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the little heart high-stepping to the music of the drum—</p>
<p class='line0'>Is it “stop it,” with a something in the young blood madly thumping</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With a foreword of the purpose of the pregnant years to come?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Mighty things were done at Casey’s. Mighty impulse was behind them,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;’Twas the sacred spark enkindled that was burning to the bone;</p>
<p class='line0'>Never yet were men more loyal to the holy ties that bind them,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the love they gave their country made me conscious of my own.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Never yet were men more loyal. Be they met in thousands teeming,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Be they gathered down at Casey’s with their kindred and their kind;</p>
<p class='line0'>They are marching on for Ireland, with the beauteous vision gleaming</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of the altar-fires of Freedom in the land they left behind.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Not a torch was ever lighted at a tomb where Freedom slumbered,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But it smouldered—grimly smouldered—till the stone was rolled away;</p>
<p class='line0'>When it flashed across the half-light, rallying rocket glares unnumbered,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like the spangled blades of morning that bespeak the march of day.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Not a voice was ever lifted, but an echo never dying</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Flung the slogan once repeated when the hand was on the gun;</p>
<p class='line0'>Though the prophet tongue was ashes, came the conquering banners flying</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With a dazzling watchword flashing, blazing signals in the sun.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yes, the world has ever seen it in its journey down the ages,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Seen it writ in living scarlet in the blood that has been shed;</p>
<p class='line0'>And a hand re-writes the head-line deep across the lurid pages,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When the stricken, fearless living meet the deathless, martyred dead.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Thrills a leaping thought within me, when I see a land around me</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That has never seen the foeman’s steel, nor heard the foeman’s shot,</p>
<p class='line0'>At whose shrine I lit the tapers, when her witching sweetness bound me</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With an iron vow of service of a pulsing pride begot;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>To that big free land I’ve given all the love that courses through me;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That her hands have rocked my cradle stirs my heart in every beat.</p>
<p class='line0'>An Australian, ay, Australian—oh, the word is music to me,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the craven who’d deny her would I spurn beneath my feet.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Thrills the thought that, did the traitor stretch a tainted hand to foil her,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Did I see her flag of silver stars a tattered thing and torn,</p>
<p class='line0'>Did I see her trampled, breathless, neath the shod heel of the spoiler,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And her bleeding wounds a byword, and her name a thing of scorn,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There would flash the living bayonets in the strong hands of my brothers,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the blood that coursed for nationhood, through all the years of pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the veins of patriot fathers and of Little Irish Mothers</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Would be hot as hissing lava streams to thrill the world again.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their new house stood just off the road,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A fine big brick two-storey,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;All gabled, tiled, and porticoed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To flaunt its owners’ glory.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We never had, to tell the truth,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;At Carey’s door alighted,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We had good reasons too, forsooth—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We hadn’t been invited.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But down to Mass we passed the gate,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And passed it, too, returning,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And hid away in mien sedate</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The grievance in us burning.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But in the Old Mass Shandrydan—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Well, envy little varies—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We heard “herself” and her good man</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Discourse about the Careys:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Wisha, that big house of Carey’s with its power of fal-de-daries.”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Faith, he’s in the bank to build it, so I hear the people say.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“It will break him now to clear it; and it’s grieved I am to hear it;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Wisha, I wouldn’t be in Carey’s boots to-day!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They came here in the early days,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And settled down as neighbours;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With tilted carts and bullock-drays</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They shared our griefs and labours.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We tramped it to the old bush school,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In fine or rainy weather;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And there upon the dunce’s stool</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We took our knocks together.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But now they stood for “class” among</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Our little congregation;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And, as they passed us by, they flung</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Mere scraps of toleration.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And sometimes down to Mass they’d bring</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fine strangers holidaying,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Who laughed and gushed at everything</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Within their orbit straying.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;By soft white hands and modish gowns</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They sought the world to measure,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And seemed to think our reach-me-downs</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were staged to give them pleasure.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And, faith, it set the tongues a-wag</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And entertained the flippants</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To see the fifteen-guinea bag</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That held the little “thrippence,”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While in the church they plied the fan</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And practised like vagaries;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So in the Old Mass Shandrydan</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We gave it to the Careys:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Wisha, did you see the Careys? They’re the high-falutin fairies.”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Tell me, who were them play-actors there that had so much to say?”</p>
<p class='line0'>“Och, the antics and the wrigglin’, and the goin’s-on and gigglin’—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Wisha, did you see the Careys there to-day!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They sometimes drove a spanking pair,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Which brought them speed and honour;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They sometimes drove a pacing-mare</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With straps and pads upon her;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They covered us with clouds of dust,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As thick as we could wear it;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And we could plod, as needs we must,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And keep the faith and bear it.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When skies were blue and days were bright,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And leaf and bud were sprouting,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They came to Mass in splendour dight,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To make a Sunday’s outing;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But when the morn was blank with storm</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And winter blasts complaining,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The Careys kept devotion warm</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Beside their fire remaining.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So, while the chilling torrents ran</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And soaked our best figaries,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Within the Old Mass Shandrydan</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We pummelled at the Careys:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Wisha, where were all the Careys? Sure the rain might melt the fairies!”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Faith, and if it was the races then, they wouldn’t stop away.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“That’d be another story; there they’d be in all their glory—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Wisha, what could keep them all from Mass to-day!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And when we held the big bazaar—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A fine and lively meeting—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And people came from near and far,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In buoyant zeal competing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;’Twas rush and gush and fulsomeness</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And Careys superintending;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They raced about in evening dress,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And deftly dodged the spending.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We might have been in Amsterdam,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Or somewhere out in Flanders;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We sold some tickets for “the ham,”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And stalked about like ganders.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So when we gathered up the clan,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And sought our distant eyries,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Within the Old Mass Shandrydan</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We blazed it at the Careys:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Wisha, did you see the Careys, like some wild things from the prairies?”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Faith, I never met ‘the bate’ of that for many ’n many a day.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“Sure it’s pounds we would have taken with them tickets for the bacon,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;If them thuckeens<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> of the Careys were not always in the way.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And when the little choir we had</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In tender hope was springing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And nervous lass and awkward lad</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were mobilized for singing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We all went down our own to hear,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As holy triumph crowned them,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But Careys sailed in shrill and clear,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And silenced all around them;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Our Nellie’s range they quite outran,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And even Laughing Mary’s;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So in the Old Mass Shandrydan</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We pitched into the Careys:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Wisha, did you hear the Careys? Don’t they think they’re fine canaries?”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Yerra, wouldn’t you think they’d hold the tongues, and let the people pray!”</p>
<p class='line0'>“Faith, my head is all a-reelin’ from them Careys and their squealin’—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Wisha, did you hear them shoutin’ there to-day!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The angels, in their peaceful skies</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through starry paddocks straying,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Must sometimes smile with kindly eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To see the tricks we’re playing.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Now rosy-cheeked and smart and fair</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Was Carey’s youngest daughter;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And lo, our Morgan did his hair</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With mutton-fat and water;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But days and days the lovers spent</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On thorns (and roses) treading,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Till down to Carey’s house we went,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Invited to the wedding.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For life’s a fine comedian,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Whose programme shifts and varies,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And in the Old Mass Shandrydan</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We smoodged a bit to Careys:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Wisha, now we’ll see the Careys in their weddin’ fal-de-daries!”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Faith, I mind the time the Careys slep’ beneath their bullock-dray.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“Sure, I wouldn’t hurt their feelin’s, though I never liked their dealin’s;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“An’ if just to please poor Morgan, I’ll be nice to them to-day.”</p>

<p class='line0'>They have brought the news, my darlin’, that I’ve waited for so long.</p>
<p class='line0'>Faith, ’twas little news they brought me; every story, every song</p>
<p class='line0'>That I’ve heard since you enlisted seemed to bear the one refrain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Till the whole world used to tell me that you’d never come again.</p>
<p class='line0'>They’ve been cruel times, alannah, since you left us for the fight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Potterin’ dazed-like all the daytime, thinkin’, thinkin’ through the night;</p>
<p class='line0'>Yerra, what’s the use complainin’, when the world is all amiss,</p>
<p class='line0'>When the hopin’ and the strivin’ ever come to dust like this.</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas the green months when you left me; now the brown, brown months have come,</p>
<p class='line0'>Stand the ripe crops in the paddocks, but the harvesters are dumb.</p>
<p class='line0'>There’ll be flowers again in plenty, and a carpet o’er the plain—</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, it’s hard you won’t be comin’ when the green months come again!</p>
<p class='line0'>Still, I’m thankful, oh, I’m thankful for one golden memory,</p>
<p class='line0'>That the last time spent together was to say The Rosary.</p>
<p class='line0'>Don’t you mind it, boy? we said it in my own room there beyond,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where I have the little altar where your early prayers you conned,</p>
<p class='line0'>By the statue that I cherish of the Holy Mother fair,</p>
<p class='line0'>With the blue cloak round her shoulders, and her white hands crossed in prayer.</p>
<p class='line0'>They were singin’ in the parlour, them that came to say good-bye;</p>
<p class='line0'>And they sang their gay songs to me—och, I knew the reason why!</p>
<p class='line0'>They are always land in trouble in this big warm-hearted land;</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah, but their way wasn’t my way, and they mightn’t understand.</p>
<p class='line0'>So I lit the little candles, and I beckoned you away,</p>
<p class='line0'>And you came—God bless you for it, boy—the partin’ prayer to say.</p>
<p class='line0'>Ay, the partin’ Rosary, darlin’—I can see you kneelin’ there,</p>
<p class='line0'>With your big broad shoulders bendin’, and your hands joined on the chair,</p>
<p class='line0'>And your man’s voice like an organ rollin’ out its soul apart—</p>
<p class='line0'>Och, to-night, boy, in my dreamin’ it is dronin’ in my heart.</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes, we said it with the music strummin’ ragtime songs throughout,</p>
<p class='line0'>Just our two selves there together, answerin’ t’other turn about.</p>
<p class='line0'>’Tis a quare, quare world, alannah, when the storm can work its stress</p>
<p class='line0'>On the strong limb, while the withered leaf is left in loneliness.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Lay your treasure up in Heaven,” for there’s nothing here below;</p>
<p class='line0'>Och, we Irish mothers learned it in the old land long ago!</p>
<p class='line0'>Short life’s springtime with its blossom; and it comes not back again,</p>
<p class='line0'>Only haggard trees in winter stretchin’ naked limbs in pain.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, I’m thankin’ God, my bouhal,<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> though the achin’s in my breast,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas He took you from me, darlin’, and He knoweth what is best:</p>
<p class='line0'>And His Holy Mother Mary, with her Baby on her knee,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sure she lost Him in His manhood, for He died at thirty-three.</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s a numbin’ in my heart, boy; like a cold, cold hand it grips—</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, I’m thankful that we parted with the Rosary on your lips.</p>
<p class='line0'>It has ever been my refuge; it has been my hope and stay,</p>
<p class='line0'>Been my hymn of sweet thanksgivin’ for what good there came my way.</p>
<p class='line0'>It has been my only comfort when the heart was sick and sore,</p>
<p class='line0'>When the bad days past the countin’ flung their troubles round my door.</p>
<p class='line0'>I was taught it by my mother; ay, and when we crossed the sea</p>
<p class='line0'>For to seek the gold we never found—the old man there and me</p>
<p class='line0'>(Sure he stood six feet and higher then, and coal-black was his hair—</p>
<p class='line0'>Och, you’d never know ’twas him at all, that bent old man in there)—</p>
<p class='line0'>We have said it in the slab hut, strong and clear in flood and drought,</p>
<p class='line0'>Just our two selves there together “answerin’ up” and “givin’ out.”</p>
<p class='line0'>We have said it by the cradle, we have said it by the cot;</p>
<p class='line0'>When the babes the angels brought us made us happy in our lot,</p>
<p class='line0'>When the house was full of childer, and the pride of livin’ glowed,</p>
<p class='line0'>Och, we said it till the neighbours heard us, passin’ on the road.</p>
<p class='line0'>But ye’ve gone and left me lonely; one by one, my doves, ye flew;</p>
<p class='line0'>One by one the circle’s dwindled, till the Rosary’s said by two—</p>
<p class='line0'>Said by two old husky voices, old and weak and wearin’ out,</p>
<p class='line0'>Just our two old selves together, answerin’ t’other turn about.</p>
<p class='line0'>Sure it won’t be long, alannah, till the troubled sea is calm,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the beads drop from my fingers, and they bind them on my arm.</p>
<p class='line0'>You would tease me with the “trimmin’s” in the dear days that are dead,</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s another trimmin’ now, boy, every time the Rosary’s said.</p>
<p class='line0'>But there won’t be many Rosaries, for the singin’s in my ears</p>
<p class='line0'>And the Holy Mother’s beckonin’—I can see her through my tears.</p>
<p class='line0'>These old feet have done their journey, better leave them restin’, then;</p>
<p class='line0'>They will bring me to the hill-side ere the green months come again.</p>
<p class='line0'>Sure I’ll tread the House of Glory, where the soul is free from harm,</p>
<p class='line0'>And you’ll know ’tis me, alannah, by the Rosary on my arm.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>To the rooms where I am dining in the glaring city’s day</p>
<p class='line0'>Come the happy honeymooners from the country far away,</p>
<p class='line0'>Two days old, and very awkward as they wander straight ahead,</p>
<p class='line0'>Much too careful lest the people should suspect them country-bred.</p>
<p class='line0'>He’s a well set-up young fellow; she’s a dainty little bride;</p>
<p class='line0'>And he follows where she leads him with the bush swing in his stride,</p>
<p class='line0'>Makes himself at home—or tries to—with defiance in his stare,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thinks he’s in the old bush kitchen with his hat beneath the chair.</p>
<p class='line0'>Every eye is turned upon them, and the kindly smiles that flit</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er the faces of the diners seem to bless them where they sit;</p>
<p class='line0'>But for me the past revives with thronging memories in its train.</p>
<p class='line0'>And I’m thinking that it’s Jim and Laughing Mary once again.</p>
<p class='line0'>Don’t I see it all before me? and I feel the mood is good—</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s the horse tied by the sliprails, and a hole worn where he stood;</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s the dreamer riding homewards while the same old fancies throng,</p>
<p class='line0'>With the same old stars a-staring, and the same old lilting song.</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s the “talkin’ matters over,” “gettin’ all arrangements straight,”</p>
<p class='line0'>Mum and Dad in the committee for the fixing of the date;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then the buggies and the jinkers at the church upon the hill,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the ribbons and the garlands, and the flounces and the “frill”;</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s the breakfast down at Mother’s—oh, the planning o’er and o’er,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the murder and the tearing that went on the day before!</p>
<p class='line0'>Working double shifts and bustling—every female in demand—</p>
<p class='line0'>Half the women of the parish round to lend a helping hand,</p>
<p class='line0'>Offering loans to bridge the shortage of the cups and spoons, and then</p>
<p class='line0'>Tying threads around the handles, so they’ll know their own again.</p>
<p class='line0'>Racing in and out and fussing, so to strike the country dumb;</p>
<p class='line0'>But they’ll talk of Mary’s wedding for a score of years to come!</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes, the breakfast down at Mother’s—there’s the long, long table spread,</p>
<p class='line0'>And a houseful of the neighbours with the old priest at their head;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the speeches—Lord, the speeches—hitting hurdles every stride,</p>
<p class='line0'>Full of awkward, heartfelt blessings for the bridegroom and the bride;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the lad himself “respondin’,” when the cheers had died away,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shifting crumbs around the table in the worst speech of the day.</p>
<p class='line0'>Don’t I see it all before me? and my heart and head resent</p>
<p class='line0'>All the smiles that patronize them, though they may be kindly meant.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Scent of gum-leaves!” ’Tis a byword in the city’s roar and push,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where they do not know the greatness and the kindness of the bush.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Scent of gum-leaves,” so they whisper. Oh, it sweetens not the air</p>
<p class='line0'>In the overcrowded city, for the spirit is not there.</p>
<p class='line0'>Scent of gum-leaves to be scoffed at in the land that gave them birth!</p>
<p class='line0'>“Scent of gum-leaves”—cease your jargon. ’Tis the finest scent on earth.</p>
<p class='line0'>Ay, it clung around the Anzacs when they stormed Gallipoli;</p>
<p class='line0'>And it steeps the nation-builders from the centre to the sea.</p>
<p class='line0'>Speed the day when all united, heart to heart and hand to hand,</p>
<p class='line0'>We’ll proclaim the scent of gum-leaves to be sacred in the land.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But my honeymooners leave me, and I watch them passing through—</p>
<p class='line0'>They are homesick for the freshness of the open spaces, too—</p>
<p class='line0'>So they gather up their bundles, and they wander home again</p>
<p class='line0'>Back to where the morning magpies lather out the old refrain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Back to love in fullest measure, pressed and flowing overtop,</p>
<p class='line0'>Through the green months and the brown months, in the house behind the crop.</p>
<p class='line0'>From the overcrowded city, from the bustle and the push</p>
<p class='line0'>Pass my sturdy, happy couples who are sticking to the bush.</p>

<p class='line0'>There’s a gloom around the kitchen where the banquet still is spread,</p>

<p class='line0'>While he searches in the by-ways, shall his heart forget the highways</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Moves aside the sombre curtain that was drawn across the past.</p>
<p class='line0'>Come the fairy visions winging, come the laughter and the singing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But the shadows fall around me and the echo dies in pain;</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet I’d feel the wings that bore me when the world was all before me,</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
